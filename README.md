# Google Services Lite - Google API for PHP

**Google Services Lite** is a lightweight and extendable library designed to help you manage data easily using the Google Sheets API in your PHP projects. Currently, it only supports the Google Sheets API, but future versions will include support for YouTube and other Google services.

## Installation

You can add this package to your projects via Composer:

```bash
composer require ceytek-labs/google-services-lite
```

## Requirements

- PHP 7.2 or higher

## Google Sheets API Usage

To use the Google Sheets API, you need to download the required authentication file and add it to your projectâ€™s root directory. Follow the steps below to set this up:

- Create a project in the Google Cloud Console.
- Enable the Google Sheets API for your project.
- Create authentication credentials for a "Service Account."
- Download the authentication JSON file and save it in your projectâ€™s root directory as `credentials.json`.
- Share the email address from the service account with the Google Sheets document you want to modify, giving it edit access.
- Donâ€™t forget to note the sheetâ€™s ID and the name of the tab you want to modify:
    - `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<id>`

## Example Usage

The following example demonstrates how to update data in a Google Sheets document:

```php
use CeytekLabs\GoogleServicesLite\GoogleSheets;

$result = GoogleSheets::make('SPREADSHEET_ID')    // Set the ID of the Google Sheets document
    ->setCredentials(__DIR__.'/credentials.json') // Set the authentication file
    ->update('Sheet1', [                          // Set the name of the tab where data will be updated
        ["Data 1", "Data 2", "Data 3"],           // Add the data to be updated
        ["Data 4", "Data 5", "Data 6"],
        ["Data 7", "Data 8", "Data 9"],
    ]);

echo 'Number of updated cells: ' . $result['updated_cells_count'];
```
